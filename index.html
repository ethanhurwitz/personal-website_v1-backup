    Greetings! My name is Ethan Hurwitz and I am a Ph.D. student in University of California, San Diego's 
    Psychology Department. By nature I am not big on having a social footprint, but have created this 
    space to contain some basic information about my work and interests! Before my graduate studies
    I worked with Dr. Roland Griffiths at the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic & Consciousness Research.
    Here at UCSD, I am a member of the <a href="https://phri.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">UCSD Psychedelics and Health Research Initiative</a>. 
    My work seeks to characterize the cognitive mechanisms underlying psychedelic therapy. I am particularly 
    interested in working to bridge the levels of analysis in psychedelic science.
